Steam:
Please set a custom URL by going to your steam profile page and click “Edit Profile.”
A few options down on the new page you'll see the “Custom URL” box.
Here you'll see your Steam ID and have the option to change it to whatever you would like.
When you're done, scroll to the bottom and click “Save Changes".
Once you have finished those steps, please relaunch the program and try again!

Spotify:
If you created your spotify without using facebook, then just enter the username you have in your profile.
If you create your spotify using Facebook, please go to https://www.spotify.com/account/overview and sign into your Spotify account using your Facebook login credientials.
From there, you will be able to access your numerical username that can be used with the program.
